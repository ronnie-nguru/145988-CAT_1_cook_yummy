# Yummy
A food recipes App Built with Jetpack Compose . The app uses room for local caching to facilitate offline support and follows the MVVM Clean Architectural pattern

### 1.UI layer
The role of the UI layer (or presentation layer) is to display the application data on the screen. Whenever the data changes, either due to user interaction (such as pressing a button) or external input (such as a network response), the UI should update to reflect the changes.
The UI layer is made up of two things:

* UI elements that render the data on the screen. You build these elements using Views or Jetpack Compose functions.
* State holders (such as ViewModel classes) that hold data, expose it to the UI, and handle logic.

### 2.Data layer
The data layer of an app contains the business logic. The business logic is what gives value to your app—it's made of rules that determine how your app creates, stores, and changes data.
The data layer is made of repositories that each can contain zero to many data sources. You should create a repository class for each different type of data you handle in your app.

### 3.Domain Layer
The domain layer is an optional layer that sits between the UI and data layers.
The domain layer is responsible for encapsulating complex business logic, or simple business logic that is reused by multiple ViewModels. This layer is optional because not all apps will have these requirements. You should use it only when needed—for example, to handle complexity or favor reusability

## Tech Stack
 - [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/) - Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise
 
 * [Jetpack Components:](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture?gclid=Cj0KCQjw8O-VBhCpARIsACMvVLOH1satX45o9f4PMQ4Sxr7bG9myl6-KZL9nYda8PJsHV7m2uJL8bzgaAmqiEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)

    * [View Model](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)-  store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
    * [Lifecycle]( https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - Perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments.
    * [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata.html) - A lifecycle-aware data holder with the observer pattern
    * [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx.html) - Android KTX is a set of Kotlin extensions that are included with Android Jetpack and other Android libraries. KTX extensions provide concise, idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack, Android platform, and other APIs.
    * [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx) - Major improvement to the original Android [Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index), which is no longer maintained.

- [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)- is a type-safe REST client for Android, Java and Kotlin, built as a powerful framework for consuming APIs

* [Dagger-Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/)- a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project

* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html) -  a persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite for cache

* [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously
* [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow)- In coroutines, a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value.
* [Ramcosta Navigation Library](https://composedestinations.rafaelcosta.xyz/) - A KSP library that processes annotations and generates code that uses Official Jetpack Compose Navigation under the hood. It hides the complex, non-type-safe and boilerplate code you would have to write otherwise.
* [CI/CD](https://codemagic.io/android-continuous-integration/) - Continuous integration systems let you automatically build and test your app every time you check in updates to your source control system. 

* [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/compose/) - Image Loader library.

* [Accompanist-SwipeRefresh](https://google.github.io/accompanist/swiperefresh/) - A library which provides a layout which provides the swipe-to-refresh UX pattern, similar to Android's SwipeRefreshLayout.

## Leaks application will be used to fix memory leaks within the kotlin app

* In the mix of things as i was following arround tutorials 
i was able to link my application to google play service 
that allows a one-tap to buy a recipe from the app but it is still something am looking into 
considering we still have cat 2 which is a continuation of this.
It has been commented out because it someting that i am still working on but it is located in the mealsScreen.kt file
